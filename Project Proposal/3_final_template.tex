\section{Introduction}

Define and motivate the problem, discuss background material or related work, and briefly summarize your approach.

\section{Related Work}

Include citations~\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03} to any papers you referenced and, if applicable, the relationship to your work.

\section{Approach}

Include any formulas, pseudocode, diagrams -- anything that is necessary to clearly explain your system and what you have done. If possible, illustrate the intermediate stages of your approach with results images.

\section{Results}

Clearly describe your experimental protocols. If you are using training and test data, report the numbers of training and test images. Be sure to include example output figures. Quantitative evaluation is always a big plus (if applicable). If you are working with videos, put example output on YouTube or some other external repository and include links in your report.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

Summarize the main insights drawn from your analysis and experiments. You can get a good project grade with mostly negative results, as long as you show evidence of extensive exploration, thoughtfully analyze the causes of your negative results, and discuss potential solutions.


\section{Statement of Individual Contribution}

Summarize who did what, including data collection, annotation, group coordination, integrating external libraries, writing source code (which component?), etc.

\section{External Resources Used}

Summarize all external resources utilized.

For any source code or libraries you used, you must include a description of how you used it and a URL (using \verb|\url{LINK ADDRESS}| like \url{http://www.cse.wustl.edu}).
