#### 4. **Blue Team** (`stuart/blue_team.py`)
- ✓ Analyzes attack images using VLM
- ✓ Generates defensive Python scripts
- ✓ Tests defenses with validator
- ✓ Refines defenses based on failures
- ✓ Targets specific accuracy thresholds
- ✓ 250+ lines of production code

**Total Phase 2: ~900 lines of production code**
