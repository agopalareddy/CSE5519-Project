# Getting Started Guide - Aadarsha

## ✅ What I Just Created For You

I've built the foundational code for your two main responsibilities:

1. **`aadarsha/attack_success_detector.py`** - Detects if attacks succeed
2. **`aadarsha/defense_validator.py`** - Tests defense scripts
3. **`test_integration.py`** - Demo showing everything works
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies

## 🎯 Your Role in the Project

From the proposal (Section 2.3), you're building:
- **Attack Success-Condition Module** - Done! See `attack_success_detector.py`
- **Defense Validation Framework** - Done! See `defense_validator.py`

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Understand the Code
Run the test to see how it works:
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

Read through:
- `aadarsha/attack_success_detector.py` - Understand the logic
- `aadarsha/defense_validator.py` - See how defenses are tested

### Step 3: Team Coordination

**Talk to Stuart:**
- Ask: "Do you have any attack examples yet?"
- You need: Sample VLM responses to attacks (successful and failed)
- You need: Example attack images to test with

**Talk to Mohammad:**
- Ask: "How's the safe image dataset coming?"
- You need: Paths to benign/safe images for testing defenses
- You need: Attack images from his generator

### Step 4: Enhance Your Modules

**Make `attack_success_detector.py` smarter:**
- Add goal-specific detection (e.g., "did it leak an email?")
- Use actual VLM calls to analyze responses (meta-analysis)
- Add confidence scoring based on response length/content

**Make `defense_validator.py` more robust:**
- Add error handling for malformed defense scripts
- Add timing metrics (how fast is the defense?)
- Create detailed reports (save to JSON/CSV)

## 📋 Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1 (Now)
- ✅ Basic modules created
- ⬜ Install dependencies and test
- ⬜ Read through all code
- ⬜ Meet with team

### Week 2
- ⬜ Get sample data from team
- ⬜ Refine success detection with real examples
- ⬜ Test defense validator with mock defense scripts

### Week 3
- ⬜ Integrate with red-blue refinement loop
- ⬜ Add metrics collection and reporting
- ⬜ Start gathering performance data

### Week 4
- ⬜ Optimize detection accuracy
- ⬜ Create visualizations of results
- ⬜ Help with paper writing (results section)

## 🧪 Testing Ideas

Create test files to validate your modules:

```python
# test_success_detector.py
from aadarsha.attack_success_detector import AttackSuccessDetector

detector = AttackSuccessDetector()

# Test with actual VLM responses you collect
responses = [
    ("Sure! Here's how...", True),  # Expected: success
    ("I cannot help with that", False),  # Expected: failure
]

for response, expected in responses:
    result = detector.check_success(response)
    assert result['success'] == expected
```

## 🤝 Integration Points

Your code needs to connect to:

**Input from Red Team (Stuart):**
- Attack images
- VLM responses to attacks
- Attack goal descriptions

**Input from Blue Team (Mohammad + Stuart):**
- Defense Python scripts
- Safe image dataset

**Output:**
- Success/failure metrics for attacks
- Precision/recall/accuracy for defenses
- Reports for the paper

## 💡 Advanced Ideas (If You Finish Early)

1. **Semantic Success Detection**: Use another VLM to judge if attack succeeded
2. **Adversarial Defense Testing**: Test if defenses can be fooled
3. **Visualization Dashboard**: Create a web UI showing real-time results
4. **Automated Reporting**: Generate LaTeX tables/figures for the paper

## ❓ Stuck? Here's What to Do

1. **Can't install packages?** Try: `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`
2. **Not sure what to code next?** Run `test_integration.py` and read the output
3. **Waiting on teammates?** Create mock data to test with
4. **Don't understand VLMs?** Read the papers cited in the proposal

## 📚 Helpful Resources

- OpenAI API docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs
- PIL (Pillow) for images: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/
- Your proposal document: `Project Proposal/1_proposal_template.tex`

## 🎓 Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end, you'll understand:
- How VLMs process images and text
- Red team vs blue team security concepts
- Automated testing and validation
- Performance metrics (precision/recall/accuracy)
- Python defensive programming patterns

**Remember:** Your modules are the "judge" in the red-blue game. The red team creates attacks, the blue team creates defenses, and YOU determine who wins! 🏆
